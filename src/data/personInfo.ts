    description:"I am an enthusiastic software engineer from Switzerland, with a strong fascination for all aspects of Artificial Intelligence. My ultimate objective is to discover AGI. As an individual who relishes coding and delving into the ever-changing realm of AI, I am constantly excited to expand my knowledge and skills in the field. When not engrossed in programming, I can be found practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, cherishing time with my loved ones, or simply appreciating the small joys in life. At present, I serve as the Head of Engineering at Brame, where we strive to transform the digital advertising industry. Our platform emphasizes developing captivating branded games, with the intention of supplanting the dull and lackluster advertisements that currently saturate the web."
