  description: `I am an enthusiastic software engineer from Switzerland, with a strong fascination for all aspects of Artificial Intelligence. My ultimate objective is to discover AGI. As an individual who relishes coding and delving into the ever-changing realm of AI, I am constantly excited to expand my knowledge and skills in the field. When not engrossed in programming, I can be found practicing Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, cherishing time with my loved ones, or simply appreciating the small joys in life. 
                At present, I am building Soulreply (r) - an AI platform that provides quick help for mental health issues. `,
